# **Differential Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2**
## **Overview**
This repository contains an analysis of RNA-seq data using the DESeq2 package in R. The primary objective was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and perform functional enrichment analysis as part of an assignment. The workflow includes preprocessing, differential expression analysis, visualization, and pathway enrichment analysis.
## **Data Used**
- **Gene expression data**: `GSE239514_HTSeq_count_matrix.csv`
- **Metadata file**: `Metadata.csv`
## **Analysis Workflow**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Read gene expression and metadata files.
- Ensured proper formatting and alignment of metadata with gene expression data.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Differential Expression Analysis
- Conducted using `DESeq2`, filtering genes with low counts.
- Generated results including log2 fold change and adjusted p-values.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
- **Volcano Plots**:
  - All genes in the dataset (**padj < 0.05**).
  - DEGs with a stricter significance threshold (**padj < 0.1**).
  - Upregulated genes in **green**, downregulated genes in **red**.
- **Bar Plot**:
  - Top 10 DEGs ranked by absolute log2 fold change.
  - Downregulated genes shown in **blue**, upregulated in **red**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Enrichment Analysis
- **Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis**:
  - Focused on **Biological Processes (BP)**.
  - Bar plot displaying the **top 10 enriched GO terms**.
- **KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis**:
  - Identified significantly enriched pathways.
  - Bar plot showing the **top 10 pathways**.
  - Pathway visualization using `pathview`.
 ## **Files Included**
- `DESeq2_results_2.csv` ‚Üí Full differential expression results.
- `upregulated_genes.csv` ‚Üí List of upregulated genes (**padj < 0.1, log2FC > 0**).
- `downregulated_genes.csv` ‚Üí List of downregulated genes (**padj < 0.1, log2FC < 0**).
- `kegg_enrichment_results.csv` ‚Üí KEGG pathway enrichment results.
